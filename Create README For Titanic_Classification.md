# Titanic Survival Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning project to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using logistic regression. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## Project Overview

The Titanic dataset is one of the most well-known datasets in the machine learning community. The goal of this project is to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on various features such as socio-economic status, age, gender, and other factors.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [Titanic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data) from Kaggle. It contains the following columns:

- **PassengerId**: Unique ID for each passenger
- **Survived**: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
- **Pclass**: Passenger class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
- **Name**: Name of the passenger
- **Sex**: Gender of the passenger
- **Age**: Age of the passenger

This program builds a linear regression model to predict the median house value in California using the California Housing dataset.
 It begins by loading the dataset and checking for missing values, then scales the features using StandardScaler.
 The data is split into training and testing sets, with the training set used to fit a linear regression model.
 The model's coefficients are extracted to understand the impact of each feature.
 The model's performance is evaluated on the test set using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²) metrics, with the results indicating the accuracy and fit of the model. 
 The output shows an MSE of approximately 0.56 and an R² value of about 0.61, reflecting the model's predictive capability.
